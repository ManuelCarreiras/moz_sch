# Grading Criteria Setup Guide

## Where to Find It

**Admin Dashboard → Academic Setup → ⚖️ Grading Criteria**

## What It Does

Define once how each subject should be graded, and it applies to ALL students in that year level across all classes.

## Example Setup: 1st Year Algebra

### Step 1: Go to Grading Criteria
1. Login as Admin
2. Click "Academic Setup"
3. Click "⚖️ Grading Criteria"

### Step 2: Filter Your View
- Select Subject: **Algebra**
- Select Year Level: **1st Year**

### Step 3: Add Components

**Component 1: Tests (60%)**
- Subject: Algebra
- Year Level: 1st Year
- Component Name: Tests
- Weight: 60
- Source Type: Assignment
- Assessment Type: Test

**Component 2: Homework (20%)**
- Subject: Algebra
- Year Level: 1st Year
- Component Name: Homework
- Weight: 20
- Source Type: Assignment
- Assessment Type: Homework

**Component 3: Attendance (20%)**
- Subject: Algebra
- Year Level: 1st Year
- Component Name: Attendance
- Weight: 20
- Source Type: Attendance
- Assessment Type: (not needed)

**Total: 100%** ✅

### Step 4: Done!

Now ALL 1st year Algebra students will be graded using:
- 60% from their test scores
- 20% from their homework scores
- 20% from their attendance percentage

**Students in 1st A, 1st B, 1st C** all use the same criteria → **Fair comparison!**

## How It Works

### Teacher Grades a Test
```
Teacher grades João's test (16/20)
↓
System finds all tests for João in Algebra Term 1
↓
Calculates average: 15/20
↓
Applies 60% weight: 9 points
```

### System Tracks Attendance
```
João attends 28 out of 30 Algebra classes
↓
Attendance: 93.3% → 18.66/20
↓
Applies 20% weight: 3.73 points
```

### System Calculates Homework
```
João completes homework (19/20 average)
↓
Applies 20% weight: 3.8 points
```

### Final Term Grade
```
9.0 (tests) + 3.8 (homework) + 3.73 (attendance) = 16.53/20
```

## Features

✅ **Total Weight Indicator** - Shows if weights add up to 100%
✅ **Color Coding** - Green when complete, yellow when incomplete
✅ **Filter by Subject + Year** - Easy to manage specific combinations
✅ **Edit/Delete** - Change criteria as needed
✅ **Automatic Application** - Works immediately when you create it

## Best Practices

1. **Set up criteria BEFORE grading** - Students can't be graded without criteria
2. **Weights must total 100%** - System validates this
3. **Be consistent** - Use same component names (Tests, Homework, Attendance)
4. **Different years can have different rules** - 1st year vs 2nd year Algebra

## Common Configurations

### Heavy Test Focus
- Tests: 80%
- Homework: 10%
- Attendance: 10%

### Balanced Approach
- Tests: 60%
- Homework: 20%
- Attendance: 20%

### Participation Heavy
- Tests: 50%
- Homework: 25%
- Attendance: 25%
